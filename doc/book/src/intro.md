# Introduction

This is the official documentation for [Muon](https://muon.build), a
meson-compatible build system.  Most of the topics discussed are muon-specific.

- For general Meson documentation refer to the [Meson User
  Manual](https://mesonbuild.com/Manual.html).
- For documentation on functions and objects refer to the
  [Muon Reference](https://docs.muon.build/reference).
